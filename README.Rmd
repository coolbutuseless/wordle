The `{wordle}` package contains code to assist in finding good candidate
words for Wordle.

"Wordle" itself is a guess-a-word puzzle [playable online](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/).

The game plays like the old 'mastermind' board game, but with letters instead of
coloured pins.  The gameplay is as follows:

1. Enter a word as a guess for the hidden target word.
2. Any letters which are within the hidden target word are coloured in yellow.
3. Any letters which match exactly the letter in the hidden target word are
   coloured green
4. Figure out a new candidate word as a guess for the hidden target word,
   and go back to Step 1.
   
In the following game of Wordle, the first guess was `eaten`, the second was
`arise`, and then the third guess really only has one good option given the
constraints revealed so far: `aside`.  This was the hidden target word, 
which means the puzzle is solved!

The process of finding good candidate words given letters which have been seen
so far is a good match for regular expressions.  This package aims to help
you find these good candidate words.

## What's in the box

- `play_wordle()` Simple way to play a game of wordle in the R console
-   `wordle_dict` an ‘official’ list of words scraped from the Wordle
    website
-   `WordleHelper` R6 Class is the primary way of finding candidate words. It
    has the following methods:
    -   `$new()` to start a new object to help with a new puzzle.
    -   `$words` to get a list of all the remaining possible valid words given the
        words and responses that have been seen so far
    -   `$update()` to notify the object of what the latest `word` was,
        and the colour responses received back from the game for each
        letter.
    -   The `Wordle` class is a stateful wrapper around `filter_words()`


Advanced:

-   `filter_words()` is a stateless function for filtering a list of
    words by various constraints on letter position.
- `WordleGame` R6 class represnting a wordle game engine
    - `$new()` to create a new game and internally choose a target word for this game
    - `$try(word)` to try a word and see what the respnse is in relation to 
      the hidden target word
    - `$share()` create a block of unicode representing the evolution of the 
      solution process.



## Installation

You can install from [GitHub](https://github.com/coolbutuseless/wordle) with:

``` r
# install.package('remotes')
remotes::install_github('coolbutuseless/wordle')
```



# Play a game

```{r eval=FALSE}
wordle::play_wordle()
```

# Solving a puzzle with `wordle::WordleHelper`

In this example, after picking my favourite starting word, I will just pick 
the first word in the alphabetical list of remaining possible words.

<img src="man/figures/00.png" />



```{r}
helper <- WordleHelper$new(nchar = 5)
length(helper$words)
head(helper$words)
```

## Initial word choice: `arose`

There are many opinions on a good starting word - I like: `arose`


<img src="man/figures/01.png" />


Update puzzle state with the word played and the response:

```{r}
helper$update("arose", c('grey', 'grey', 'grey', 'yellow', 'green'))
helper$words
```


## Choose the first word: `besee`

<img src="man/figures/02.png" />


Update puzzle state with the word played and the response:

```{r}
helper$update("besee", c('grey', 'yellow', 'yellow', 'grey', 'green'))
helper$words
```

## Choose the first word:  `esile`

<img src="man/figures/03.png" />


Update puzzle state with the word played and the response:

```{r}
helper$update("esile", c('yellow', 'yellow', 'yellow', 'grey', 'green'))
helper$words
```

## Choose the first word:  `siege`

<img src="man/figures/04.png" />


**Success!**



# Optimizing word selection

In the above worked example no effort was made to optimize the word choice - instead
the first word in the alphabetical list of remaining words was chosen.

There may be opportunities to pick the "best" word that helps to solve the puzzle faster,
but no such code is included in this package - yet!

For example, it may be possible to pick the word that when played results 
in the most *other* words in the remaining list of words to be eliminated.


# Tweetable Wordle Game Engine

A playable game of Wordle in a tweet.

This was an exercise to see if I could simplify the WordleGame into just 280 characters. It's mostly unreadable, and lacks safety checks, but it works!

```{r eval = FALSE}
#RStats #wordle in a tweet
s=\(x)el(strsplit(x,''))
t=s(sample(grep("^[a-z]{5}$",readLines('/usr/share/dict/words'),v=T),1))
while(1){g=s(readline("? "))
M=t==g
r=which(!M)
for(i in r)for(j in r)if(g[i]==t[j]){M[i]=2;r=r[r!=j]}
cat(paste0('\033[48;5;',c(249,46,226)[M+1],'m ',g))}
```

# Expert Function: `filter_words()`

The `Wordle` R6 class is just a stateful wrapper around a core function 
called `filter_words()`.

In general you wouldn't need to call this function for solving a Wordle puzzle
but it might come in handy for other word puzzles.

In this example, I'm searching for a word:

* with 9 letters
* starting with `p`
* containing `v` and `z` somewhere, but not as the first letter
* containing only one `z`
* without an `a` or an `o` in it

```{r collapse=FALSE}
words <- readLines("/usr/share/dict/words")

filter_words(
  words            = words,
  exact            = "p........",
  wrong_spot       = c("vz", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""),
  min_count        = c(v = 1),
  known_count      = c(z = 1, a = 0, o = 0)
)
```
